        Hello! I'm <span class="text-cyan-600 dark:text-cyan-400 font-semibold">Grantly Sorongan</span>, a passionate software developer who enjoys building things on the internet. My interest in web development started back when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together HTML & CSS is pretty fun!

        Currently, my main focus is on building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences for a variety of clients. I love learning new technologies and keeping up with the latest trends in the tech world.
